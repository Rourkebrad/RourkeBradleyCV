# PHPUserAuthentication
You have a Todo Application that will allow you to added, edit, delete, and check off tasks. You also have some friends who are looking for a way to track their own todos. You're ready to put this one the internet and share it with your friends, but you don't want everyone to have access to everyone else's todos. Before you can go live, you need to lock this app down with some User Authentication. 

Allow new users to register for your application. Store the user's password as a hash.
Add the ability for a user to login to your application
Add the ability to log out of your application
Allow users to update their password
Assign all new tasks to the logged in user
Only return tasks belonging to the logged in user
ONLY the home, registration, and login pages should be accessible for unauthenticated visitors. All other pages should require authentication.
